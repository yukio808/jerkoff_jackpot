# jerkoff_jackpot
hello and welcome to the jerk off jackpot read.me
here you will have access to the javascript and index.html documents.
##
The jerkoff jackpot application you see before you is a text array acceser that gets random elements in an array and shows them in  the form of a slot machine


This app is pure fun and just senseless humor created by accessing 3 different arrays that are seperated in adverbs adjectives and nouns respectively. 
the arrays are here already preset in the javascript file and can be freely edited to your preference. 

In these documents all code (ie. variables functions arrays), are all defined in a comment that shows what each variable represents, what every function does to the slot machine, and what each array represents dhown directly after the line of code.

In the css file all peramiters can be changed for user preference but is highly reccomended against by our bada$$ css coder Joelle. 

all javascript was writen and inputed by Yukio and Teresa.

Use our code freely and enjoy the text generator. but most importantly enjoy the coding.

Karen handled all the data so yah. she has a !$ mindset
